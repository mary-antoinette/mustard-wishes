                    <h2>Understanding the Vibes</h2>
                    <p>Of all the visual elements of art, color is probably the one that makes
                        some of the most understandable impact. While line and volume
                        lends an element of balance to a piece, color is something even the
                        least trained art viewer can recognize and name. They probably have a favorite color themselves based on associations they’ve created whether green because it reminds them of money or brown because they just have strong feelings about rye bread.</p>


                    <p>A piece can show a harmonious blend of monochromatic colors or create a strong impact with high contrasting colors. The usage of warm tones like reds and oranges could serve to represent a warm hearth feeling or one else a chaotic scene of a city set on fire. The
                        usage of predominately cool tones can create a sense of peace, like
                        waterlilies in the spring or else one of a morose rainy night.</p>

                    <p>Personal and cultural associations can also come into play when using colors. For example, red and green are high contrast complementary colors that can make an image pop but also have strong cultural associations with Christmas while othe ultures could see it without imagining gift wrap.</p>

                    <p>In design, the usage of color adds to everything, like readability-
                        you wouldn’t want to use a teal font on a peach background unless you were somehow seeking to punish the reader. Color can add a focal point to the information you’re looking to relay. By using
                        bright colors that pop, you draw the eye immediately to that point.</p>

                    <p>On the other hand, too many bright focal points add a chaotic sense
                        to a design, keeping anythign from being the real focus other than
                        the insane usage of color itself. Perhaps good for a children’s toy but
                        lacking in the nuance needed to effectively communicate a message
                        otherwise just as using too many muted colors would work to keep
                        a calming effect but lack the contrast to really draw the eye to any particular point. Even notoriously colorphobic goths know the value of a strong red accessory in completing a full look.</p>
                    <p>Finding balance in one’s usage of color is essential to creating a
                        well designed piece of art and is one of the keys to creating a strong
                        emotional message, whether intended or not, so understanding it’s
                        importance is crucial in making sure you are creating exactly what
                        you intend.</p>
